Write generate documentation for the code.

Later on change float32 to float64 to see if it can improve precision, for now I think it 
is pretty precise. I compared it to the tool on regex.info and I seem to land on the same 
house using my tool and using the tool on regex.info

Cleanup README!

Decide about possibly cleaning up/deleting Hasgps.go

Remember to go fmt everything before commiting.

Delete some pictures in ExifCrawl repo which is related to this one, or atleast using this one. 

Put Xx_test.go files in main repo, pictures for testing are in testdata/

Add method to take io.Reader to ContainsStdin and StdinDecode.

Maybe write more tests?
