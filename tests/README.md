README:
-------

Just some tests I'm doing with the test package, everything is copied here from the main directory of GoExifGPS. If you would like to run these tests too, just download the pictures with the same name from github.com/kurtcc/ExifCrawl

If you want the pictures I'm using here just in this directory you cloned do:
$ wget https://raw.github.com/kurtcc/ExifCrawl/master/_JEF018993_sm.jpg
# The above is from blog.regex.info and contain gps data.
$ wget https://raw.github.com/kurtcc/ExifCrawl/master/FdPNK.png 
# One png file so we can see how GoExifGPS reacts to *.png
$ wget https://raw.github.com/kurtcc/ExifCrawl/master/WTgX4.jpg i
# This jpeg has no gps data.

On my local version of this repo I have all the above pictures I just didn't get add them
so cloning this repo won't clone them you will have to manually wget them to have them.
